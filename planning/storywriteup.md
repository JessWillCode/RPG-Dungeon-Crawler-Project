// You wake up on the ground, shivering. You have an awful headache. It is pitch black. You don\'t know where you are. As a matter of fact, you dont know who you are. Who are you? 
--input name--

// Now that we\'ve established who you are, what are you? You look to be a warrior of some sort, but what kind of warrior? A mage? a paladin? an archer? --select class--

// You\'ve sat here for a while now, and you eyes have had time to adjust. You notice the outline of a heavy wooden door, off in the distance. Looking around you you see a ragged looking leather chest, ((essentials-items depending on choice made, compass))

// You can sit here forever if you\'d like, but I dont much like the atmosphere here. How deep underground even are we? It stinks, it\'s dark and it\'s cold, and I\'d like to get out, and the only way forward I can see is through that door. 

// Upon opening the door, you are immediately confronted with an overpowering stench and the noises of grumbly muttering, hooting and stamping. In the corner you see a piteous beast, a goblin of some sort, hideous and filthy as can be. Just as you notice the creature he swivels his malformed head toward you and charges, stamping in your direction faster than ever. You are faced with a choice. What will you do?

-- retreat
// You made it out of there safe, but in a display of cowardice. I\'ve lost respect for you, ${player.name}. Now you\'re back in the dingy cellar you started out in. The only way out is forward! 

-- fight
// dialogue options for fight mechanic, not ironed out yet.

-- death due to stupidity (unlikely) 
// You\'re dead! You died! In normal life, that would be permanent. Luckily this is an amateurish web hosted RPG made by students, so you can start back over. 
-- restart



// The beast thrashes
